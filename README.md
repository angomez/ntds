Network tour of data sciences project

For this project we use the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset. it is a free and open library.
The goal of this project is to examine how music tracks relate to each other. Does genre structure the music? We are
working with music from the genre "Rock" and "hip-hop". Do we observe group of similar artists?
To answer those questions, we are building a similarity graph between music tracks.
